# iNClusive Updates

Update (starting 15.05.2024)
The update was started by scraping new papers for the paperbase with the keywords listed in the paper ("Mass spectrometry" "tRNA synthetase" "unnatural amino acid", ...). The search was conducted for papers published in 2023-2024, no further time specification could be achieved as ‘Publish Or Perish 8’ does not have this function.
New Papers were scraped on 15.05.2024 with the following amounts

| MS termology              | UAA  | ncAA | nsAA |
| ------------------------- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ‘Mass spectrometry’       |  194 |  149 |    8 |
| ‘Electrospray ionization’ |   39 |   31 |    3 |
| ‘Electrospray ionisation’ |    3 |    4 |    1 |
| ‘MALDI’                   |   41 |   44 |    2 |
| ‘MS/MS’                   |   79 |   62 |    6 |

After merging the various scraped entries, duplicates were removed using Excel's "Remove duplicates" function. The publications were checked for duplicates via the "Title" header by comparing them with the title of the publication. After removing the duplicates (571 duplicates between hits), 321 remained for further analysis. Before further processing, these hits were compared with the entries from the first publication that had already been processed. After deducting the hits that had already been processed, 138 hits remained. These hits were then manually checked for dissertations (brown), reviews and books (purple), preprints (blue), protocols (orange), English-language research articles (green), and research articles in a language other than English (yellow). As only English-language primary research articles were processed, 64 articles remained. In addition, 4 research articles were not included as they did not meet the criteria of these articles, as well as 14 research articles that were stuck in our pipeline. Between the 4 and 14 research articles, 1 duplicate was found. This leaves 81 research articles to be processed for the 2024 summer update.
